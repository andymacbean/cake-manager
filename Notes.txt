#NOTES#
Decided NOT to add any new dependencies/libraries and purely just get working and tidy up using existing dependencies.  The reason for this is
that I felt that if i was ablke to use new dependencies/libraries it would have been an almost re-write and not my interpretation of the task.

If I had added new dependencies I would have considered the following:
- log4j or similar to replace the System.out/err calls
- Spring for a number of reasons inncluding dependency injection, util to make http calls and a controller impl with rest based unit tests
- Mockito or EasyMock to add more complete unit testing
