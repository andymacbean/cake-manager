#NOTES#
Decided NOT to add any new dependencies/libraries and purely just get working and tidy up using existing dependencies.  The reason for this is
that I felt that if i was able to use new dependencies/libraries it would have been an almost re-write and that wasn't my interpretation of the task.

If I had added new dependencies and use other technologies I would have considered the following:
- Log4j (or similar) to replace the System.out/err calls
- Spring for a number of reasons but primarily dependency injection and improved testability
- Mockito (or EasyMock) to add more complete unit testing
